There are a couple of ways to get community support as well as one-on-one
support. We do prefer the public chats because that allows community members to
answer when we're busy though.

* **IRC:** `#nixnet` on [NixNet's IRC server](https://docs.nixnet.services/IRC)
  (also on [Libera](https://libera.chat))
* **Telegram:** `@NixNetChat`
* **XMPP:** `nixnet@muc.nixnet.services`
* **Matrix:** `#nixnet:snopyta.org`

If you need to communicate one-on-one or in an encrypted manner, there are
additional options.

* Email
  * General support with no encryption but quicker responses: `support@nixnet.services`
  * Amolith: `amolith@nixnet.services`, [`amolith.txt`](/amolith.txt) (GPG key)
  * Manton: `manton@nixnet.services`, [`manton.txt`](/manton.txt) (GPG key)
* XMPP
  * General support: `support@nixnet.services`
  * Amolith: `amolith@nixnet.services`
