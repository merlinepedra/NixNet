Because I'm terrible at remembering to do things and this canary hadn't been updated for nearly two weeks after the deadline, I'm going to modify the process a little. Rather than reposting it every month, simply watch the line below. Other than occasionally incrementing the date, if it changes, something's up. If it doesn't, everything is fine.

Note the updated PGP key. It can be found at [/amolith.txt](/amolith.txt)
