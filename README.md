# NixNet

This repo houses the source to [NixNet.services](https://nixnet.services), a network of libre services run by Amolith.

It is also a part of the [LibreHo.st](https://libreho.st)ers, "a network of cooperation and solidarity that uses free software to encourage decentralisation through federation and distributed platforms. Our values connect transparency, fairness and privacy with a culture of data portability and public contributions to the commons."

## Issues
If you have any problems with or improvements to the website itself, open an issue/pull request here and I'll take a look at it! For problems with services I run, [drop me a line](https://nixnet.services/contact/) somewhere (anywhere on that page) and I'll see what's up!
